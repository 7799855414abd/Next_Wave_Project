Project Overview:

This is a web application built using React.js.
It has two main sections: the login page and the home page.
Components:

1>LoginPage:
It's the first page users see.
Users enter their email and password here to log in.
If the email and password are correct, users are directed to the home page.

2>HomePage:
Once logged in, users land here.
It displays jokes from different categories.
Users can view random jokes and enjoy a good laugh.

3>Routing:
The app uses React Router for navigation.
There are routes set up for the login page and the home page.

4>State Management:
React's useState hook manages the state.
Each component has its own state for email, password, errors, and joke data.

5>Styling:
Bootstrap CSS is used for styling components and layout.
Some custom CSS is applied for additional styling.

6>Authentication:
Users need to enter their email and password to access the home page.
If the login credentials are correct, users are redirected to the home page.

7>Navigation:
Users can move between the login page and the home page seamlessly.
React Router's navigation methods are used for this purpose.
